 * Description: Lab.Act.#03 - Working with 2D Arrays - The objective of this activity is to
 *                              reinforce understanding of 2D arrays in Java and practice basic array traversal
 *                              and searching algorithms. By completing this activity,
 *                              students will gain proficiency in iterating over 2D arrays, accessing elements,
 *                              and identifying the maximum element along with its position in the array.
