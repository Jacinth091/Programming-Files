Soul Knight esque rpg rouge-like

I think the most important aspect of Roguelikes is permadeath.

Other important aspects IMO are passive items, carry over progression, skippable levels (Curse of the Necrodancer).

roguelikes are "turn-based, grid-based dungeon crawlers with permadeath and procedural generation", or "meaningless term of loosely related design decisions used as a buzzword to generate more traffic",

Core Gameplay

Player will traverse to the dungeon, as the player traverse , he will unlock something of use 
(player movement = sprint ability ) or his ability to use skills, inventory 
Basically all his necessities are unlock through exploration. He should be able to explore the floors to survive and unlock his basic necessities.


In order to survive, TBA.....
